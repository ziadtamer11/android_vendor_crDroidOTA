!!! Attention !!!
Now we will use a fork of KernelSU from rsuntk.
If you have the KernelSU manager installed, you must, before updating
the firmware, revoke the SU permission from all programs that have
been granted root rights. You must also remove all installed
modules and the KernelSU manager itself.
After updating the firmware, you can reinstall the kernelSU manager.
